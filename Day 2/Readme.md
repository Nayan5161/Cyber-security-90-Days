Welcome back to my Cyber Security Internship Diary This repository documents my daily learnings and experiences during my internship in the field of Cyber Security. Here, I'll share insights, concepts, and practices that I encounter throughout this journey.

## Day 2: Introduction to Linux

### Key Concepts and Topics

#### **Introduction to Linux**
- **Definition:** Linux is an open-source operating system known for its flexibility, security, and robustness, making it widely used in the field of cyber security.

#### **Setting Up the Linux Environment**
- **Tools Used:**
  - **[Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads):** Download Kali Linux for cyber security tasks and simulations.
  - **[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads):** Download VirtualBox for setting up a Linux environment.

#### **Basic Linux Commands**
- ```ls```: Lists directory contents.
- ```pwd```: Prints the current working directory.
- ```cd```: Changes the current directory.
- ```mkdir```: Creates a new directory.
- ```rm```: Removes files or directories.

#### **Networking Commands**
- ```ifconfig```: Configures network interfaces.
- ```ping```: Checks the network connection to a server.
- ```netstat```: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
- ```traceroute```: Traces the route packets take to a network host.
- ```nslookup```: Queries internet domain name servers.

#### **Service and Logs**
- ```service```: Manages system services.
- ```systemctl```: Controls the systemd system and service manager.
- ```journalctl```:Queries and displays messages from the journal.

#### **System Administration Commands**
- ```sudo:``` Executes a command as another user, typically the superuser.
- ```apt-get ```: Manages packages (installation, updates).
- ```top ```: Displays tasks and system resource usage.
- ```chmod ```: Changes file permissions.
- ```chown ```: Changes file owner and group.

#### **Linux File System / Directories**
- ```/```: Root directory.
- ```/bin```: Essential command binaries.
- ```/etc```: Configuration files.
- ```/home```: User home directories.
- ```/var```: Variable files like logs.
- ```/usr```: User programs and data.
